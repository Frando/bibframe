bibfra.me vocabularies 
========

The supporting vocabularies in this respository reflect
[Zepheira's](http://zepheira.com) approach to modular, layered
vocabulary management.  These vocabularies are being shaped by a range
of related professional services engagements along with Zepheira's [Practical
Practitioner, Linked Data training
series](http://zepheira.com/solutions/library/training/). The data diagnostic, transformation and
enhancement services, along with these supporting vocabularies shared
here, are evolving in collaboration with hundreds of practitioners
participating in this series. Online data diagnostic, transformation
and enhancement services that use these vocabularies are available to
participants in this training curriculum. The results from this
collaboration however are available as [open source
software](https://github.com/zepheira/pybibframe) for all to benefit
from.
